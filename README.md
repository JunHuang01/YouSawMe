iOS-App-For-YouSawMe
======================

www.yousawme.com owner Seth McBee needed an app to help him log customer data at trade shows.  I vonlunteered to help.

Form App for iPads that can be used offline and dump data when you have WiFi, great tool for big conventions

If user input "Admin" in First Name, Last Name, and Email field and hit next, you will be redirected to the admin page.

Once on the admin page you can sen out the sqlite file to email of your choice.

This app works without wifi, it's great to collect customer data with this at trade show.  Once you have a stable connection, you can export all data to a CSV file.
