iOS-App-For-RunJumpDev
======================

Form App for iPads that can be used offline and dump data when you have wifi, great tool for big conventions


The app is a straight forward form app, taking the customer's name,email, game prefrecens, and comments.

If inputing "Admin" in First Name, Last Name, and Email field and hit next, you will be redirected to the admin page.

Once on the admin page you can sen out the sqlite file to email of your choice.

I vonlunteered to help RunJumpDev, a local Lexington, KY game developer organization, to build this for their PAX Convention 2014.

Google form is nice, but once you have lots of people at one place, routers can only accept 100 people before they starts kicking people off.

Therefore, it is nice to have something that don't need internet connection.  And it is a native iOS app that looks great.
